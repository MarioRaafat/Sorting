# Merge Sort

## Overview
Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves.

## How It Works
1. Divides the array into two halves.
2. Recursively sorts each half.
3. Merges the sorted halves to form a sorted array.

## Time Complexity
- **Best Case (Ω)**: \(O(n log n)\)
- **Average Case (Θ)**: \(O(n log n)\)
- **Worst Case (O)**: \(O(n log n)\)

## Space Complexity
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) (not in-place)

## Best Use Cases
- Stable sorting is needed
- Large datasets
- Linked lists
