# Selection Sort

## Overview
Selection Sort finds the minimum element from the unsorted portion and moves it to the sorted portion.

## How It Works
1. Repeatedly finds the minimum element.
2. Moves it to the sorted portion of the array.
3. Continues until the entire array is sorted.

## Time Complexity
- **Best Case (Ω)**: \(O(n^2)\)
- **Average Case (Θ)**: \(O(n^2)\)
- **Worst Case (O)**: \(O(n^2)\)

## Space Complexity
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) (in-place)

## Best Use Cases
- Simple implementation
- Small arrays or memory-constrained applications
