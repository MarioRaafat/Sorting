# Bubble Sort

## Overview
Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent items, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Larger elements "bubble up" to the top.

## How It Works
1. Compares adjacent elements in each pass.
2. Swaps elements if they are out of order.
3. Continues until no swaps are required.

## Time Complexity
- **Best Case (Ω)**: \(O(n)\) (when array is already sorted)
- **Average Case (Θ)**: \(O(n^2)\)
- **Worst Case (O)**: \(O(n^2)\)

## Space Complexity
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) (in-place)

## Best Use Cases
- Educational purposes
- Not suitable for large datasets due to inefficiency
